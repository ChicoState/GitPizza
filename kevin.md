# Kevin's Special Pizza

This is Kevin's go-to homemade pizza. Get ready for a kick of spice!

## Ingredients

- Pre-made sourdough dough
- San Marzano tomatoes (one can, peeled)
- Red wine (dry red, such as Chianti)
- Garlic clove
- Fresh basil
- Mozzarella (fresh pre-sliced log)
- Pecorino cheese (shaved)

- Spicy Italian sausage (without casing)

## Directions

1. Flatten dough as thin as you can without any translucent spots

3. In a blender, mix and blend the tomato, pressed garlic, 5 leaves of basil, and a half glass (3 oz) of wine
4. Line the outer circumference of the dough with pieces of pecorino cheese
5. Spoon some of the sauce (from step 3) to cover the dough with a thin layer, but without covering the cheese-line crust.
6. Sprinkle small pieces of the sausage over the sauce.
7. Distribute the mozzarella chese on top of the sauce and sausage.
8. Cut olives into rings or halves and distribute over the cheese and sauce.
9. Cut pepper into rings (or diced) and distribute over cheese. For less spice, remove the seeds and placenta.
10. Pre-heat oven for 450-degrees and place preparation on pizza stone
11. Start drinking remainder of wine bottle.
12. Bake until cooked with golden crust, or until you've had too much wine and need some food.
